            <p> Hello! I'm <b>Kushwanth</b> a 3rd-year B.Tech student in IT with a passion for creating innovative solutions. On this website, you'll find a collection of my projects, skills, and experiences that showcase my skills and interests. I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn from others, so feel free to reach out! My interest in technology started at a young age, and over the years, I've developed a strong foundation in programming languages, data structures, and software development. I'm excited to share my knowledge and skills with others and learn from their experiences as well.</p>
